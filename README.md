# Project Video Game AI

### Some Useful Software:
We will use Python 3.6 or higher. I personally reccomend downloading the Pycharm IDE, where you can use your student .edu account to get a free developer copy for a year by making a JetBrains account. More information here: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/.  

This is completely optional.  

### Python Packages 
After installing python, please open your commandline and type in:  
`pip install pygame`  
`pip install neat-python`  

Note, for Linux/Mac users you make have to use the following to explicitly install to python3 not python2.  
`pip3 install pygame`  
`pip3 install neat-python`
